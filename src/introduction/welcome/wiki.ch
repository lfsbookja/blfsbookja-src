  <para>When <emphasis>editor notes</emphasis> are present, a link
  appears in the form <literal>&blfs-wiki;/pkgname</literal> right
  below the dependency list. The idea behind the editor notes is to
  give additional information about the package and/or its build
  instructions, common pitfalls or maybe even more sophisticated
  configuration for special cases of use.</para>

      The <emphasis>editor notes</emphasis> might be outdated. Even
      though the pages should be reviewed when a package is updated,
      it might happen that there are notes referring to an obsolete
      version and therefore, the notes might be out of date. Always
      check the date of the notes and more importantly, the version
      of the package the notes refer to.
